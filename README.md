##  Run the next command lines to getting started 💻

First you'll have to clone this repository in a folder in your computer, then you'll have to open your console in that directory and: 

- cd api
- npm install 
- npm start

This will start the back-end server on your localhost:3001/

Then you must go back to the root directory of the project and: 

- cd client
- npm install
- npm start 

This will start the app on your localhost:3000

Aditionally you'll have to create your local SQL database called 'food' in order to store your own dogs.
